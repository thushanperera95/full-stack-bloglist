# Full Stack Bloglist

This was created for exercise 11.21 - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further#exercises-11-19-11-21

Combined the bloglist frontend with the bloglist backend into the one repo. I decided to keep the backend and frontend in separate folders to minimise the changes required.

App is deployed and available here - https://full-stack-bloglist.herokuapp.com/
